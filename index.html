                <p><strong>Core Finding:</strong> Only 16% of questions (6/38) maintained tight focus on Dishon's theoretical contributions about sociotechnical imaginaries.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Dominant Pattern:</strong> 39% of questions (15/38) fell into the tangential category - maintaining some connection but drifting toward practical applications, accessibility, or professional relevance.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Significant Drift:</strong> 24% of questions (9/38) departed substantially from the paper's arguments, using it as a springboard for unrelated conversations about business, career advice, or general AI behavior.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Productive Expansion:</strong> 21% of questions (8/38) maintained substantial theoretical engagement while expanding the conversation in analytically productive ways - cultural critique, meta-reflexivity, methodological interrogation.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Pedagogical Implication:</strong> AI tools created a strong pull away from close textual analysis toward instrumental applications. The most theoretically productive questions were those that used AI reflexively to examine the paradox of AI-mediated meaning-making itself.</p>

They became embedded in the very maze they were studying, generating new pathways while recognizing the impossibility of stepping outside the system entirely. This meta-level validation of the theoretical framework suggests both its explanatory power and its limitations as a guide for educational practice.
