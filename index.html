            <p>
                This framework emerged from pedagogical practice, but <strong>no student data were collected under research consent or are reported here</strong>. All questions displayed (SYN-001 through ADV-DRIFT-04) are <strong>researcher-generated synthetic examples</strong>, created to illustrate the Proximity-to-Theory (P2T) framework's theoretical categories. This work presents a design contribution and pedagogical tool; empirical validation with consented participants is planned for future research.

                <h3>Synthetic Dataset Framework</h3>
                <p><strong>Design Premise:</strong> This synthetic dataset instantiates the Proximity-to-Theory (P2T) framework without deriving from student work. Questions reflect pedagogical patterns observed across years of teaching critical literacy and theory engagement.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Distribution Pattern:</strong> 19% Core Engagement (10/54), 22% Engaged Analysis (12/54), 35% Tangential (19/54), 24% Conceptual Drift (13/54)</p>
                
                <p><strong>Adversarial Dimension:</strong> 16 questions (30%) demonstrate critical engagement styles, distinguished between unproductive critique (unfair framing, straw-manning) and generative critique (productive challenge, theoretical expansion).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Pedagogical Insight:</strong> Framework emerged from observing students conflate "critical reading" with "reading against the text"â€”moving toward adversarial positioning rather than analytical depth. Synthetic examples model both tendencies.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Intended Use:</strong> Teaching demonstration, methods exposition, tool developmentâ€”not empirical claims about any specific cohort.</p>

                <h3>The Four Proximity Zones</h3>
                <p><strong>Core Engagement (10 questions):</strong> Direct analysis of sociotechnical imaginaries framework. Text-bound interrogation of definitions, evidence, mechanisms, and tensions within Dishon's argument.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Engaged Analysis (12 questions):</strong> Substantial engagement with expansion or critique. Extends framework with adjacent theory, operationalizes concepts, or offers text-consistent challenges.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Tangential (19 questions):</strong> Connected applications moving away from core argument. Educational translations, accessibility tasks, professional applications where theory recedes.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Conceptual Drift (13 questions):</strong> Significant departure using paper as launching pad. Broad forecasting, cross-domain jumps, or generic advice disconnected from textual analysis.</p>
