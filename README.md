# Reading-With-AI

This artifact was built based upon annonymized student responses to the below reading activity:

Reference text (OA, CC BY 4.0):
Dishon, G. (2024). From Monsters to Mazes: Sociotechnical Imaginaries of AI Between Frankenstein and Kafka. Postdigital Science and Education, 6, 962–977. Open Access on SpringerLink.

What to do
Preview the text. Read the article on your own. Note key claims, questions, definitions, and tensions.
Upload the article to an LLM of your choice. Good options include ChatGPT, Claude, NotebookLM, and Gemini. 
Prompt practice. Consult Reading With AI in the MET AI Literacy Hub. Choose two prompts from that guide and run them on the full article or a targeted section.
Design your own prompt. Based upon your explorations and interest in the text, create one original, targeted prompt that digs into a thread you care about (e.g., a theoretical move, assumption, method). More nuanced, specific questions tend to yield better outputs.
Central discussion questions: 

Which strategic, creative, or associative prompts can you use with an LLM to engage more deeply with a text?
What are the two central narratives of this text and which one do you find most useful or evocative for understanding genAI? 


Discussion post:
In a short 150–200 word reflection or vlog please share:
The most generative prompt you used and why you chose it.
What is one thing you discovered in the text with the help of the LLM?
Were you able to “have a conversation with the text” (iterate prompts, check claims against the PDF, refine your questions)?
Make sure to review this thread for ideas about different ways to interrogate or read a text using the help of an LLM!

Copyright & Uploading to LLMs — Quick Guide

Key points
Uploading text to an AI tool usually involves copying and may create derivatives.
Prefer sources with CC BY or CC0 (OK to copy/transform with attribution). Be cautious with NC and avoid ND.
Do not upload materials created by instructors, TAs, or classmates unless you have explicit permission.
Check privacy too: avoid uploading personal or sensitive data to unvetted tools (e.g., FOIPPA considerations in BC).
When in doubt, link to the source or use brief quotations (as permitted), and always attribute.
